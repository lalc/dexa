This paper is a collaborative project at the 11th Rebooting of Web of Trust (RWOT) workshop in The Hague in September 2022. It was introduced first via multiple Next Generation Internet consortium projects, eSSIF-Lab and ONTOCHAIN. We present the Data Exchange Agreement (DEXA) protocol suite that enables human-centric automated agreement handling for data exchange between a Data Source (DS) and a Data Using Service (DUS). It helps organisations to be transparent and legitimate in their data usage while leveraging data in a scalable manner as part of a data ecosystem. Furthermore, the DEXA protocol brings in the requisite trust and governance to establish a ubiquitous data exchange data space while empowering individuals to be in control of their data. All organisations need to ensure that they are on the right side of the law (e.g. the GDPR) when consuming personal data (risk management) and to establish the digital trust needed for individuals to say yes to sharing their data.

Using OCA (Overlay Capture Architecture) in DEXA ensures cross-border data exchange across multiple jurisdictions while addressing accessibility concerns.

In our scenario, a healthcare provider in Sweden could leverage the protocol to publish the availability of their prescriptions, in Swedish, in a cross-border healthcare data space. A Pharmacy in Zurich could sign up to read the prescription in German and issue a generic medicine to Fredrik. The use of OCA enables language localisation and ensures Fredrik, who is visually impaired, can understand the Data Agreement presented by the Pharmacy during the transaction. All transactions are auditable, and Fredrik is issued a receipt with a warning in Swedish for the possible adverse effects of taking the medicine.
